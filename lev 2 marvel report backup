# MECHANICAL TASKS
## CFD Simulation
#### For this task I first designed NACA 4412 aerofoil in fusion 360. And then simulated in wind tunnel using CFD. The inlet air flow was set. to 28 m/s and the outlet was kept unknown to get the exact value of the air flow after passing through the aerofoil. I choose aluminium material for the aerofoil due to its lightweight and sustainable nature. Obtained around 25 iterations for generating the graph and then visualised the result using traces feature. The summary was generated. And the data obtained can be used to calculate the lift and the drug forces.

## Generative Design
#### Generative Design is a process that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and computational design software to create multiple design solutions based on a set of parameters and constraints. Instead of designing a product manually, designers provide the software with information about the desired function, materials, manufacturing methods, and other constraints. The software then generates numerous design options that meet these criteria.
#### For this task I first made an aircraft fuselage using fusion 360. And then specified the load constraints and the preserved body and obstacle constraints after that I selected the materials titanium 6AI-4V, stainless steel AISI 446, aluminium and steel AISI 8640 361 QT. Then after running the pre check test I generated outcomes around 4 to 8 out comes were generated.

## Assembly and Simulation of Gripper
#### Assembly is the process of combining individual components or parts into a larger, more complex product. It's a fundamental operation in manufacturing, engineering, and construction. Assemblies can range from simple structures to intricate machines.
#### A gripper is a mechanical device designed to grasp, hold, or manipulate objects. It's often used as an end-effector for robotic arms, allowing them to interact with the physical world. Grippers can be designed in various configurations depending on the specific application and the type of objects they need to handle.
#### Referenced the given CAD drawings and assembled a gripper using fusion 360. First I had to complete the individual components after that using the assembly environment in fusion 360 I assembled all the parts together to complete the gripper.

#   ELECTRONIC TASKS
## Logic Design: Full Adder
#### A full adder is a digital logic circuit that performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers and a carry-in bit, producing a sum bit and a carry-out bit. It is a fundamental building block in digital circuits, used extensively in arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#### The full adder operates based on the following truth table:
![image](https://github.com/anwayimaske/Report-images/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-05%20090502.png?raw=true)
#### From the truth table, we can observe the following rules for calculating the sum and carry-out bits:
#### Sum: The sum bit is 1 if an odd number of inputs (A, B, or Carry-in) are 1. Otherwise, it is 0.
#### Carry-out: The carry-out bit is 1 if two or more inputs are 1. Otherwise, it is 0.
#### A full adder can be implemented using various combinations of logic gates, such as AND, OR, and NOT gates.
#### Applications of Full Adders:
#### Ripple-Carry Adders: Full adders are used in cascade to create ripple-carry adders, which can add multi-bit binary numbers.
#### Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs): ALUs, which perform various arithmetic and logical operations, often use full adders as their fundamental components.
#### Digital Computers: Full adders are essential in the design of digital computers for performing arithmetic operations.

# Filter Design: Second-Order Bandpass Filter with LTspice
#### A second-order bandpass filter allows signals within a specific frequency range (bandwidth) to pass through while attenuating signals outside that range. We can design this filter using an operational amplifier (op-amp) like the IC741 and passive components like resistors and capacitors. But i used OP747 because IC 741 was unavailable in LTSpice.

# Voltage Multiplier
#### Used TinkerCad's component library to build a voltage multiplier circuit with a 555 Timer IC, capacitors, and diodes.Simulated the circuit to verify the functionality of the first voltage doubler stage (9V to 18V).Designed a cascaded version of the voltage doubler to achieve a final output of 27V. This involved replicating the initial circuit and connecting them strategically. Simulated the entire cascaded circuit to confirm the 27V output and analyze its performance under various load conditions.A voltage multiplier is an electrical circuit that converts a low-voltage AC or DC to a higher voltage. the circuit was made using 555IC timer and capacitor pumps. Initially, I faced issues with the task but was able overcome it with the help of coordinators.
